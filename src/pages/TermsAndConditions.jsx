Accounts which meet this criteria will be debited a monthly maintenance fee in the amount of the lesser of $2.00 or the current account balance.

WhizDeals.ca reserves the right to cancel, suspend and/or modify a user&rsquo;s account, entire Promotion, or any part of it, or the payment of any Rewards amounts at any time without obligation or notice to you, including, without limitation, if any fraud, technical failures, limit of available Rewards, gaming, human error or any other factor impairs the integrity, availability or proper functioning of the Promotion, as determined by WhizDeals.ca in its sole discretion. Without limiting anything&nbsp; in these Promotion Terms or the Terms of Use, WhizDeals.ca reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to disqualify, terminate or suspend the participation in any Promotion, or otherwise prevent future participation, of any individual it &#64257;nds, or reasonably suspects, to be tampering with the operation of a Promotion (including by submitting or attempting to submit fraudulent or ineligible Receipts) or to be acting in violation of the Promotion Terms or any promotion,&nbsp; or in behaving in an unethical, dishonest, deceptive or disruptive manner. Any attempt by any person to deliberately undermine the legitimate operation of the Promotion may be in violation of criminal and civil law, and, should such an attempt be made, WhizDeals.ca reserves the right to seek damages from any such person to the fullest extent permitted by law.

Binding Arbitration</span></p><p className="c2"><span className="c1">In the unlikely event that you&rsquo;re not satisfied with customer service&rsquo;s solution, and you and WhizDeals.ca are unable to resolve a dispute through the Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures below, we each agree to resolve the dispute through binding arbitration or small claims court instead of in courts of general jurisdiction.</span></p><p className="c2"><span className="c5">Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Unless expressly limited by this arbitration provision, arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.&nbsp;</span><span className="c1">Any arbitration under this Agreement will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted.</span><span className="c3">&nbsp;In arbitration you may be entitled to recover attorneys&rsquo; fees from us to the same extent as you would be in court.</span></p><p className="c2"><span className="c1">ARBITRATION AGREEMENT</span></p><p className="c2"><span className="c5">(1)&nbsp;</span><span className="c1">Claims Subject to Arbitration</span><span className="c5">: To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, WhizDeals.caand you agree to arbitrate&nbsp;</span><span className="c1">all disputes and claims</span><span className="c3">&nbsp;between us, except for claims arising from bodily injury or that pertain to enforcing, protecting, or the validity of your or our intellectual property rights (or the intellectual property rights of any of our licensors, affiliates and partners). This Arbitration Agreement is intended to be broadly interpreted. It includes, but is not limited to:</span></p><ul className="c12 lst-kix_list_6-0 start"><li className="c4 li-bullet-0"><span className="c3">claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, fraud, misrepresentation or any other statutory or common-law legal theory;</span></li></ul><ul className="c12 lst-kix_list_7-0 start"><li className="c4 li-bullet-0"><span className="c3">claims that arose before this or any prior Agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising);</span></li></ul><ul className="c12 lst-kix_list_8-0 start"><li className="c4 li-bullet-0"><span className="c3">claims for mental or emotional distress or injury not arising out of physical bodily injury;</span></li></ul><ul className="c12 lst-kix_list_9-0 start"><li className="c4 li-bullet-0"><span className="c3">claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a current member of a certified class; and</span></li></ul><ul className="c12 lst-kix_list_10-0 start"><li className="c4 li-bullet-0"><span className="c3">claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.</span></li></ul><p className="c2"><span className="c5">References to &ldquo;WhizDeals.ca,&rdquo; &ldquo;you,&rdquo; &ldquo;we&rdquo; and &ldquo;us&rdquo; in this Arbitration Agreement include our respective predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as our respective past, present, and future parents, subsidiaries and affiliates (including WhizDeals.ca, Inc., WhizDeals.ca, LLC, Everyday Health, Inc., Everyday Health Media, LLC, and their affiliates); those entities and our respective agents, employees, licensees, licensors, and providers of content as of the time your or our claim arises; and all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of Services under this or prior Agreements between us. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may elect to have claims heard in small claims court seeking only individualized relief, so long as the action is not removed or appealed to a court of general jurisdiction. This Arbitration Agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, provincial, or local agencies.&nbsp;</span><span className="c1">You agree that, by entering into this Agreement, you and we are each waiving the right to participate in a class action and to a trial by jury to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.</span><span className="c3">&nbsp;</span></p><p className="c2"><span className="c5">(2)&nbsp;</span><span className="c1">Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures</span><span className="c3">: You and we agree that good-faith, informal efforts to resolve disputes often can result in a prompt, cost-effective and mutually beneficial outcome. Therefore, a party who intends to initiate arbitration or file a claim in small claims court must first send to the other a written Notice of Dispute (&ldquo;Notice&rdquo;). A Notice from you to WhizDeals.ca must be emailed to info@WhizDeals.ca (&ldquo;Notice Address&rdquo;).</span></p><p className="c2"><span className="c3">Any Notice must include (i) the claimant&rsquo;s name, address, and email address; (ii) a description of the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; (iii) if you are submitting the Notice, any relevant facts regarding your use of the Sites, including whether you have created an account with or receive any newsletters associated with any of the Sites; (iv) a description of the nature and basis of the specific relief sought, including the damages sought, if any, and a detailed calculation for them; and (v) a personally signed statement from the claimant (and not their counsel) verifying the accuracy of the contents of the Notice. The Notice must be individualized, meaning it can concern only your dispute and no other person&rsquo;s dispute.&nbsp;</span></p><p className="c2"><span className="c3">After receipt of a completed Notice, the parties shall engage in a good faith effort to resolve the dispute for a period of 60 days (which can be extended by agreement). You and we agree that, after receipt of the completed Notice, the recipient may request an individualized video settlement conference (which can be held after the 60-day period) and both parties will personally attend (with counsel, if represented). If you are unable to participate in the settlement conference by video, you may attend telephonically upon showing of good cause or extraordinary circumstances warranting telephonic participation (e.g., inability to afford equipment or sufficient Wi-Fi due to indigent circumstances). You and we agree that the parties (and counsel, if represented) shall work cooperatively to schedule the conference at the earliest mutually convenient time and to seek to reach a resolution. If we and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the issues identified in the Notice within 60 days after the completed Notice is received (or a longer time if agreed to by the parties), you or we may commence an arbitration proceeding or a small claims court proceeding (if permitted by small claims court rules).</span></p><p className="c2"><span className="c3">Compliance with this Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures section is a condition precedent to initiating arbitration. Any applicable limitations period (including statute of limitations) and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the informal dispute resolution procedures set forth in this Section 13(2). All of the Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures are essential so that you and WhizDeals.ca have a meaningful opportunity to resolve disputes informally. If any aspect of these requirements has not been met, a court of competent jurisdiction may enjoin the filing or prosecution of an arbitration. In addition, unless prohibited by law, the arbitration administrator may not accept, administer, assess, or demand fees in connection with an arbitration that has been initiated without completion of the Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures. If the arbitration is already pending, it shall be administratively closed. Nothing in this paragraph limits the right of a party to seek damages for non-compliance with these Procedures in arbitration.</span></p><p className="c2"><span className="c5">(3)&nbsp;</span><span className="c1">Arbitration Procedure</span><span className="c5">: </span><span className="c15">(to be inserted)</span></p><p className="c2"><span className="c3">All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except as otherwise expressly provided herein. The arbitrator may consider but shall not be bound by rulings in other arbitrations involving different customers.</span></p><p className="c2"><span className="c5">(4)&nbsp;</span><span className="c1">Arbitration Fees</span><span className="c3">: The payment of arbitration fees (the fees imposed by the arbitration administrator including filing, arbitrator, and hearing fees) will be governed by the applicable NAM Rules, unless you qualify for a fee waiver under applicable law. If after exhausting any potentially available fee waivers, the arbitrator finds that the arbitration fees will be prohibitive for you as compared to litigation, we will pay as much of your filing, arbitrator, and hearing fees in the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive, regardless of the outcome of the arbitration, unless the arbitrator determines that your claim(s) were frivolous or brought for an improper purpose or asserted in bad faith. You and we agree that arbitration should be cost-effective for all parties and that any party may engage with NAM to address the reduction or deferral of fees.</span></p><p className="c2"><span className="c5">(5)&nbsp;</span><span className="c1">Confidentiality</span><span className="c3">: Upon either party&rsquo;s request, the arbitrator will issue an order requiring that confidential information of either party disclosed during the arbitration (whether in documents or orally) may not be used or disclosed except in connection with the arbitration or a proceeding to enforce the arbitration award and that any permitted court filing of confidential information must be done under seal to the furthest extent permitted by law.</span></p><p className="c2"><span className="c5">(6)&nbsp;</span><span className="c1">Offer of Settlement</span><span className="c3">: In any arbitration between you and WhizDeals.ca, the defending party may, but is not obligated to, make a written settlement offer at any time before the evidentiary hearing or, if a dispositive motion is permitted, prior to the dispositive motion being granted. The amount or terms of any settlement offer may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator issues an award on the claim. If the award is issued in the other party&rsquo;s favor and is less than the defending party&rsquo;s settlement offer or if the award is in the defending party&rsquo;s favor, the other party must pay the defending party&rsquo;s costs incurred after the offer was made, including any attorney&rsquo;s fees. If any applicable statute or case law prohibits the shifting of costs incurred in the arbitration, then the offer in this provision shall serve to cease the accumulation of any costs to which the party bringing the claim may be entitled for the cause of action under which it is suing.</span></p><p className="c2"><span className="c5">(7)&nbsp;</span><span className="c1">Requirement of Individualized Relief</span><span className="c5">: The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party&rsquo;s individual claim.&nbsp;</span><span className="c1">TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH PARTY MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR OUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL PROCEEDING</span><span className="c3">. Further, unless both you and we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person&rsquo;s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative, class, or private attorney general proceeding. If, after exhaustion of all appeals, any of these prohibitions on non-individualized declaratory or injunctive relief; class, representative, and private attorney general claims; and consolidation are found to be unenforceable with respect to a particular claim or with respect to a particular request for relief (such as a request for injunctive relief sought with respect to a particular claim), then the parties agree such a claim or request for relief shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction, after all other arbitrable claims and requests for relief are arbitrated. You agree that any arbitrations between you and WhizDeals.ca will be subject to this Section and not to any prior arbitration agreement you had with WhizDeals.ca, and, notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, you agree that this Section 13 amends any prior arbitration agreement you had with WhizDeals.ca, including with respect to claims that arose before this or any prior arbitration agreement.&nbsp;</span></p><p className="c2"><span className="c5">(8)&nbsp;</span><span className="c1">Opt Out of Future Changes</span><span className="c3">: Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, if WhizDeals.ca makes any future change to this Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to the Notice Address), you may reject any such change by sending WhizDeals.ca an email to info@WhizDeals.ca within 30 days of the posting of the amended arbitration agreement that provides: (i) your full legal name, (ii) your complete mailing address, (iii) your phone number, (iv) if applicable, the username or email address associated with any potential account or newsletter; (v) the relevant Site; and (vi) the approximate date of your initial use of the relevant Site. Such an opt-out email must be sent by you personally, and not by your agent, attorney, or anyone else purporting to act on your behalf. It must include a statement, personally signed by you, that you wish to reject the change to the Arbitration Agreement. This is not an opt out of arbitration altogether.</span></p><p className="c2"><span className="c5"><br/></span><span className="c1">(9) Severability</span><span className="c3">: If any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is found to be void, invalid, or otherwise unenforceable, then that portion shall be deemed to be severable and, if possible, superseded by a valid, enforceable provision, or portion thereof, that matches the intent of the original provision, or portion thereof, as closely as possible. The remainder of this Arbitration Agreement shall continue to be enforceable and valid according to the terms contained herein.</span></p><p className="c7"><span className="c8 c5">14. CLASS ACTION AND JURY TRIAL WAIVER</span></p><p className="c2"><span className="c3">You and WhizDeals.ca agree that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, each party may bring claims (whether in court or in arbitration) against the other only in an individual capacity, and not participate as a plaintiff, claimant, or class member in any class, collective, consolidated, private attorney general, or representative proceeding. This means that you and WhizDeals.ca may not bring a claim on behalf of a class or group and may not bring a claim on behalf of any other person unless doing so as a parent, guardian, or ward of a minor or in another similar capacity for an individual who cannot otherwise bring their own individual claim. This also means that you and WhizDeals.ca may not participate in any class, collective, consolidated, private attorney general, or representative proceeding brought by any third party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you or WhizDeals.ca may participate in a class-wide settlement. To the fullest extent permitted by law, you and WhizDeals.ca waive any right to a jury trial.</span></p><p className="c7"><span className="c5 c8">15. Limitation Period for Claims</span></p><p className="c2"><span className="c3">You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of our sites or the Agreement must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.</span></p><p className="c7"><span className="c8 c5">16. Miscellaneous</span></p><p className="c2"><span className="c5">We may be required by international, provincial or federal law to notify you of certain events. You hereby acknowledge and consent that such notices will be effective upon our posting them on our sites or delivering them to you through e-mail. Subject to the arbitration provision above and for all purposes of this Agreement, this Agreement shall be construed in accordance </span><span className="c15">with Canadian law</span><span className="c3">. You and WhizDeals.ca each irrevocably consent within the jurisdiction of Canadian law with respect to any action, suit or proceeding arising out of or related to this Agreement or to the Services (including without limitation any Content) and waive any objection to venue in any of the Courts for such an action, suit or proceeding ; additionally, you agree that you will not bring any such action, suit or proceeding in any court other than the Courts.</span></p><p className="c2"><span className="c3">This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all previous written or oral agreements between the parties with respect to such subject matter. If any inconsistency exists between the terms of this Agreement and any additional terms and conditions posted on the Services, such terms shall be interpreted as to eliminate any inconsistency, if possible, and otherwise, the additional terms and conditions shall control. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, (i) such provision shall be interpreted in such a manner as to preserve, to the maximum extent possible, the intent of the parties, (ii) the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby, and (iii) such decision shall not affect the validity, legality or enforceability of such provision under other circumstances.&nbsp; WhizDeals.ca&rsquo; failure to enforce any term of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of that provision.&nbsp; No waiver shall be binding unless in writing and signed by WhizDeals.ca, and such waiver shall not be construed as WhizDeals.ca&rsquo; waiver of any other or subsequent breach.</span></p><p className="c7"><span className="c8 c5">17. Privacy Policy</span></p><p className="c2"><span className="c3">The applicable privacy policy will be made available on the property from which you accessed these Terms. Such privacy policy is incorporated by reference into these Terms.</span></p><p className="c2"><span className="c5"><br/></span><span className="c1">QUESTIONS?</span><span className="c5 c9">Please contact </span><span className="c5">info@WhizDeals.ca</span><span className="c5 c9">&nbsp;and insert&nbsp;</span><span className="c1 c9">&ldquo;Terms of Use&rdquo;</span><span className="c5 c9">&nbsp;in the subject line if you have any questions or comments about the Agreement, or to report user conduct violating the Agreement.</span></p><p className="c20 c24"><span className="c19"></span></p>
